# The Inquisition

![Ordo-Xenos](./Images/Ordo-Xenos.png)

The Ordo Xenos study, exploit and eradicate the alien. Most Ordo Xenos Inquisitors dedicate their lives to combating a single species above all else, for there are as many different races in the galaxy as there are stars, and no one being could hope to battle them all. Both Puritan and Radical Ordo Xenos Inquistors seek to learn all they can of their prey, studying examples of the aliens' technology and lore, and dissecting them where possible. Puritans draw the line at disgusted comprehension, using the knowledge they have gained to better exterminate the species in which they specialise. Radicals seek ways to integrate the xenos' secrets into their wargear and doctrines, even employing retinues of alien mercenaries and cultivating contacts within their societies. All work towards the same goals, however: the elimination of the alien threat and the eventual galactic supremacy of Humanity.

These records bring together the collected knowledge of the Xenos races inhabiting the known galaxy. Hated and reviled by the Imperium, they are in a constant battle for survival and conquest amidst the endless galactic war.[[1]](#1)
